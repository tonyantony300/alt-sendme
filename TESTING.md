# 🧪 Testing Instructions

## ✅ **Second Fix Applied**

We've identified and fixed **TWO critical issues** with the Tauri sender:

1. **Progress task was dropping** → Fixed by keeping `_progress_handle` alive
2. **Store was dropping** → Fixed by keeping `_store` alive

## 🚀 How to Test

### Test 1: Tauri (Send) → CLI (Receive)

**Terminal 1 - Start Tauri App:**
```bash
cd /Users/tonyantony/better-sendme/web-app
npm run tauri dev
```

Then in the app:
1. Click "Send" tab
2. Select a file or folder
3. Click "Start Sharing"
4. Copy the generated ticket

**Terminal 2 - Receive with CLI:**
```bash
cd /Users/tonyantony/better-sendme
sendme receive <paste-ticket-here>
```

**Expected Result:** ✅ File downloads successfully

---

### Test 2: CLI (Send) → Tauri (Receive)

**Terminal 1 - Send with CLI:**
```bash
cd /Users/tonyantony/better-sendme
sendme send /path/to/your/file
```
Copy the ticket from output.

**Terminal 2/Tauri App - Receive:**
1. In Tauri app, click "Receive" tab
2. Paste the ticket
3. Click "Receive"

**Expected Result:** ✅ File downloads to Downloads folder

---

### Test 3: Tauri → Tauri (Two Instances)

**Instance 1:**
```bash
cd /Users/tonyantony/better-sendme/web-app
npm run tauri dev
```
- Send a file, get ticket

**Instance 2 (new terminal):**
```bash
cd /Users/tonyantony/better-sendme/web-app
npm run tauri dev
```
- Receive the file using the ticket

**Expected Result:** ✅ Should work (but requires two separate app instances)

---

## 📊 What to Watch For

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- No "connection lost" errors
- No "stream reset by peer" errors
- File downloads complete
- Progress shows in terminal (for CLI)

### ❌ If Still Failing:
Check the logs for:
- Connection establishment (should succeed)
- Blob header reading (should not error)
- Data transfer progress

---

## 🔍 Log Messages to Look For

### Sender Side (Tauri):
```
✅ Share started successfully
✅ Endpoint is online
📍 Node address: relay=..., addrs=[...]
```

### Receiver Side (CLI):
```
✅ Connection established successfully
📊 Getting file sizes...
⬇️  Starting data transfer...
📥 Downloaded: X bytes
✅ Download complete!
```

---

## 💡 Quick Verification

The **fastest way** to verify the fix:

1. Start Tauri app, share a small file (~1MB)
2. In another terminal: `sendme receive <ticket>`
3. If it downloads without errors → **FIX WORKS!** 🎉

---

## 🐛 Still Having Issues?

If you still see errors after this fix, please share:
1. The complete error message
2. Logs from both sender and receiver
3. File size and type being transferred

The fix addresses the **lifecycle management** of critical components. Both the progress monitoring task AND the file store now stay alive for the entire sharing session.
