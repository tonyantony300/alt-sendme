## What seems to be going wrong?

Please describe what's happening and what you would have expected instead.

## How can we reproduce this?

1.
2.
3.

## Your environment

- DashBeam version:
- OS and version (e.g. macOS 14, Windows 11, Fedora 41, Android 14):
- How you installed it (.AppImage, .deb, .rpm, Flatpak, .msi, .exe, .dmg, .apk):
- Did it work in an earlier version? If so, which:

**If the problem involves Nearby / local discovery**, please also tell us:

- Are both devices on the same Wi-Fi/LAN (not guest network)?
- Any VPN enabled on either side?
- Discoverability setting on each device (Settings → Network → Your discoverability):

**If the problem involves sending or receiving files**, please also tell us:

- The other device's platform and version:
- Relay mode (Settings → Network → Relay servers), Automatic / Custom / Disabled:
- Does **Test connection** succeed on both devices?

**If the problem is visual** (a blank window, rendering glitches, missing UI) and
you're on Linux:

- Desktop environment, and Wayland or X11 (`echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`):
- Graphics hardware (`fastfetch --pipe` or `inxi -GSx`):

## Logs

Logs make almost every report faster to resolve.

For transfer, connection, relay or pairing problems, the easiest way is **Settings →
General → Debug logging**, then restart, reproduce, and **Save diagnostics…**. If the app
won't open or shows a blank window, use the `RUST_LOG` commands instead. Both are covered
in [collecting logs](https://github.com/tonyantony300/dashbeam/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#collecting-logs).

Please open the file and check it before attaching. It includes IP addresses, device
identifiers, your device name, and names of files you shared.
