# Sendme Desktop

This is the desktop version of Sendme, built with Tauri + React. It provides a graphical interface for the same P2P file sharing functionality as the CLI version.

## Features

- **Send Files**: Drag and drop or select files/folders to share
- **Receive Files**: Paste a ticket to download shared files
- **Simple UI**: Clean, minimal interface with tabbed navigation
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.81+
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Running in Development

1. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd web-app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the desktop app**:
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo tauri dev
   ```

This will:
- Start the Vite dev server on port 1420
- Build and run the Tauri desktop app
- Enable hot reload for both frontend and backend changes

### Building for Production

1. **Build the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd web-app
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Build the desktop app**:
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo tauri build
   ```

The built app will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Usage

### Sending Files

1. Click on the "Send Files" tab
2. Either:
   - Drag and drop a file/folder onto the drop zone
   - Click "Select File" or "Select Folder" to browse
3. Click "Start Sharing"
4. Copy the generated ticket and share it with others
5. Keep the app open while others download your files
6. Click "Stop Sharing" when done

### Receiving Files

1. Click on the "Receive Files" tab
2. Paste the ticket you received from someone
3. Click "Receive File"
4. Files will be saved to your Downloads folder

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri framework
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Core Logic**: Shared library between CLI and desktop versions
- **File System**: Uses Tauri's secure file system APIs
- **Networking**: Same Iroh P2P networking as CLI version

## CLI Compatibility

The desktop version uses the same core networking library as the CLI version, so:
- Tickets generated by CLI can be used in desktop
- Tickets generated by desktop can be used in CLI
- Both versions can send/receive to each other

## Troubleshooting

- **App won't start**: Make sure you have Rust and Node.js installed
- **File selection doesn't work**: Check that the app has file system permissions
- **Network issues**: Same troubleshooting as CLI version (firewall, NAT, etc.)
- **Build errors**: Try `cargo clean` and rebuild

## Differences from CLI

- **No progress bars**: Simplified UI without detailed progress tracking
- **No concurrent operations**: Only one send or receive at a time
- **Automatic cleanup**: App closes sharing when you close the window
- **File dialogs**: Uses system file dialogs instead of command line paths
- **Downloads folder**: Always saves to Downloads folder (configurable in future)
