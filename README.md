## Features

- **NAT Hole Punching**: Iroh handles NAT traversal automatically, falling back to a relay if needed
- **Verified Streaming**: Blake3-verified streaming ensures data integrity
- **Resumable Downloads**: Interrupted downloads can be resumed seamlessly
- **Cross-Platform**: Native desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Modern UI**: React-based interface built with modern web technologies
- **Secure**: 256-bit node IDs with TLS encryption
- **CLI Compatible**: Works seamlessly with the [sendme](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme) CLI tool 


### macOS Installation 

Alt-Sendme is currently distributed **without code signing**. When you first open it, macOS will show a security warning saying the application is damaged. Here is how you can run it:


**Remove Quarantine Flag (Terminal)**

1. Open Spotlight Search (⌘+space) - search for terminal and open
2. Paste the following command and hit enter

```bash
cd /Applications && xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine AltSendme.app
```

The app is open source and safe - the warning is just macOS's gatekeeper for unsigned applications. Code signing will be added in future releases.


## CLI Compatibility

The AltSendme uses the same core networking library as the [sendme](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme), so:
- Tickets generated by CLI can be used in desktop
- Tickets generated by desktop can be used in CLI
- Both versions can send/receive to each other


## Development

If you want to contribute or run the app from source:

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.81+
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Running in Development

1. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd web-app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the desktop app**:
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo tauri dev
   ```

This will start the app with hot reload enabled for both frontend and backend changes.


### Building Locally


 1. **Build stage**:
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo tauri build --no-bundle
   ```
 2. **Run**:

  ```bash
   cd src-tauri/target/release
   ./alt-sendme        # macOS or Linux
   alt-sendme.exe      # Windows
   ```
