# Alt - Sendme

> **Note**: This is a fork of [sendme](https://github.com/n0-computer/sendme) that has been substantially modified into a Tauri desktop application with a modern web-based UI.

A cross-platform desktop application using [iroh](https://crates.io/crates/iroh) with
the [iroh-blobs](https://crates.io/crates/iroh-blobs) protocol to send files and
directories over the internet.

Built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) for a native desktop experience with a modern React-based UI.

## Features

- **NAT Hole Punching**: Iroh handles NAT traversal automatically, falling back to a relay if needed
- **Verified Streaming**: Blake3-verified streaming ensures data integrity
- **Resumable Downloads**: Interrupted downloads can be resumed seamlessly
- **Cross-Platform**: Native desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Modern UI**: React-based interface built with modern web technologies
- **Secure**: 256-bit node IDs with TLS encryption
- **CLI Compatible**: Works seamlessly with the original sendme CLI

## Installation

Better Sendme is currently in development. Pre-built binaries will be available soon.

For developers, you can build from source:

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo tauri build
```

## Development

If you want to contribute or run the app from source:

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.81+
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Running in Development

1. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd web-app
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the desktop app**:
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo tauri dev
   ```

This will start the app with hot reload enabled for both frontend and backend changes.

## Usage

### Sending Files

1. Click on the "Send Files" tab
2. Either:
   - Drag and drop a file/folder onto the drop zone
   - Click "Select File" or "Select Folder" to browse
3. Click "Start Sharing"
4. Copy the generated ticket and share it with others
5. Keep the app open while others download your files

### Receiving Files

1. Click on the "Receive Files" tab
2. Paste the ticket you received from someone
3. Click "Receive File"
4. Files will be saved to your Downloads folder

All connections are encrypted and verified using blake3 hashing. The application handles NAT traversal automatically and will use relay servers as a fallback when direct connections aren't possible.

## CLI Compatibility

The desktop version uses the same core networking library as the CLI version, so:
- Tickets generated by CLI can be used in desktop
- Tickets generated by desktop can be used in CLI
- Both versions can send/receive to each other

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri framework
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Core Logic**: Shared library between CLI and desktop versions
- **File System**: Uses Tauri's secure file system APIs
- **Networking**: Same Iroh P2P networking as CLI version

## Troubleshooting

- **App won't start**: Make sure you have Rust and Node.js installed
- **File selection doesn't work**: Check that the app has file system permissions
- **Network issues**: Same troubleshooting as CLI version (firewall, NAT, etc.)
- **Build errors**: Try `cargo clean` and rebuild
