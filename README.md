A free and open-source file transfer tool that harnesses the power of [cutting-edge peer-to-peer networking](https://www.iroh.computer), letting you transfer files directly without storing them on cloud servers.

Why rely on WeTransfer, Dropbox, or Google Drive when you can reliably and easily transfer files directly, end-to-end encrypted and without revealing any personal information?


## Features

- **Send anywhere** – Works seamlessly on local networks or across continents.
- **Peer-to-peer direct transfer** – Send files straight between devices, with no cloud servers or intermediaries.
- [**End-to-end encryption**](https://www.iroh.computer/docs/faq#how-secure-is-irohs-end-to-end-encryption) – Always-on protection with QUIC + TLS 1.3 for forward and backward secrecy.
- **No accounts or personal info** – Transfer files without sign-ups or exposing private data.
- [**Transfer anything**](https://www.iroh.computer/proto/iroh-blobs) – Send files or directories of any size, verified with BLAKE3-based integrity checks.
- **Resumable transfers** – Interrupted downloads automatically resume where they left off.
- **Fast & reliable** – Capable of saturating multi-gigabit connections for lightning-fast transfers.
- [**NAT traversal via QUIC**](https://www.iroh.computer/docs/faq#does-iroh-use-relay-servers) – Secure, low-latency connections using QUIC hole punching with encrypted relay fallback.
- **CLI integration** – Interoperable with the [Sendme CLI](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme).
- **Mobile & web** – Coming soon.
- **Free & open source** – No upload costs, no size limits, and fully community-driven.

  </tr>
</table>


*For running on macOS, see [macOS Installation (Unsigned App)](#macos-installation) below.


More download options in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tonyantony300/alt-sendme/releases).



### macOS Installation 

Alt-Sendme is currently distributed **without code signing**. When you first open it, macOS will show a security warning saying the application is damaged. Here is how you can run it:


**Remove Quarantine Flag (Terminal)**

1. Open Spotlight Search (⌘+space) - search for terminal and open
2. Paste the following command and hit enter

```bash
cd /Applications && xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine AltSendme.app
```

The app is open source and safe - the warning is just macOS's gatekeeper for unsigned applications. Code signing will be added in future releases.


## CLI Compatibility

The AltSendme uses the same core networking library as the [sendme](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme), so:
- Tickets generated by CLI can be used in desktop
- Tickets generated by desktop can be used in CLI
- Both versions can send/receive to each other



## Supported Languages


- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇹🇭 Thai
- 🇩🇪 German
- 🇨🇳 Chinese
- 🇯🇵 Japanese
- 🇷🇺 Russian




## Development

If you want to contribute or run the app from source:

### Prerequisites
