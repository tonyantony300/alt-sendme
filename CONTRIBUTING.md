# Contributing to DashBeam

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This guide covers local setup and how to submit changes.

## Development setup

**Prerequisites:** Rust 1.91+, Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (recommended: 24 — see `.nvmrc`), pnpm 10+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonyantony300/dashbeam.git
cd dashbeam
pnpm install
```

### Desktop

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

Production build (skips installer/bundle packaging):

```bash
pnpm tauri build --no-bundle
```

### Web app setup

Use the web target to run the app in a browser during development.

Start the web dev server:

```bash
pnpm build:wasm   
pnpm dev:web
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/`.

Production web build:

```bash
pnpm build:web
pnpm preview:web
```

### Android

```bash
pnpm android:dev
```

### Nix / NixOS

A flake dev shell provides the pinned Rust toolchain (with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target), Node, pnpm, and the full WebKitGTK stack `tauri dev` needs — no system packages required.

```bash
nix develop      # or `direnv allow`, which uses the checked-in .envrc
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
```

The shell reads `rust-toolchain.toml`, so bumping the pin there is enough — the flake follows it.

Notes:

- **`programs.nix-ld.enable = true;`** is required on NixOS. pnpm downloads prebuilt binaries (Biome, Rollup, esbuild) that expect a standard dynamic loader; without nix-ld they fail with "no such file or directory" on an executable that plainly exists.
- **`wasm-bindgen-cli` must match `wasm-bindgen` in `wasm-bridge/Cargo.lock` exactly.** The shell warns on entry if nixpkgs has drifted and prints the `cargo install` line that fixes it.
- **Android is not covered** by the shell — the SDK/NDK are still on you.
- **Bundling** (`pnpm tauri build` with installers) is not supported on NixOS; use `--no-bundle`.
- The shell sets `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`, which avoids a blank webview on NVIDIA and older Mesa. Drop it from `flake.nix` if your setup doesn't need it.

### Project layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `frontend/` | React UI (Tauri + web targets) |
| `src-tauri/` | Tauri desktop/Android shell |
| `engine/` | Rust P2P transfer engine |
| `www/` | Public Next.js site (planned) |

## Testing

To exercise transfers on a single machine, install the [Sendme CLI](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme) and share files locally — traffic stays on your device.

Engine E2E tests:

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path engine/Cargo.toml
```

## Commit messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Format:

```text
type(scope): short description
```

Examples:

```text
fix(android): invalid sharesheet info
feat(discovery): optional DNS origin support
chore(nix): add flake and .envrc
docs: update contributing guide
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`. Scope is optional (`android`, `tls`, `ui`, …).

After `pnpm install`, Husky installs a `commit-msg` hook that runs [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/). Invalid messages are rejected locally. Prefer fixing the message over `--no-verify`.

**PR titles use the same format** and are enforced in CI (`Lint PR title`). PRs are squash-merged using the PR title as the commit on `main`, so the title is what lands in history and release notes.

## Pull requests

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/tonyantony300/dashbeam/issues) before opening a new one.
2. For bugs, use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report-bug.md).
3. Use a conventional PR title (required — CI will fail otherwise), for example `fix(android): invalid sharesheet info`.
4. Run checks before opening a PR:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format
```

5. Fill out the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
**Lockfiles:** Do not commit lockfile-only changes. CI rejects PRs that modify `pnpm-lock.yaml` or `Cargo.lock` without a corresponding manifest change.

```bash
git checkout origin/main -- pnpm-lock.yaml src-tauri/Cargo.lock engine/Cargo.lock
```
