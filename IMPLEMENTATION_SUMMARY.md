# Backend Implementation Fixes - Summary

## Date: October 24, 2025

This document summarizes the critical fixes and improvements made to align the Tauri backend implementation with the CLI version.

---

## Critical Fixes Implemented ✅

### 1. Graceful Router Shutdown with Timeout (Priority 1 - HIGH)

**File**: `src-tauri/src/state.rs`

**Problem**: Router was dropped without graceful shutdown, potentially leaving connections hanging and causing data corruption on active transfers.

**Solution**: 
- Added explicit temp_tag drop before router shutdown (matches CLI implementation)
- Implemented graceful router shutdown with 2-second timeout
- Added proper cleanup sequence: temp_tag → router → store → blobs directory
- Changed cleanup errors to warnings (best effort) instead of hard failures

**Impact**: Active transfers now terminate gracefully, preventing data corruption and connection hangs.

### 2. Resumable Download Progress Tracking (Priority 1 - HIGH)

**File**: `src/core/receive.rs`

**Problem**: Progress bar reset to 0% when resuming partial downloads instead of continuing from the already-downloaded position.

**Solution**:
- Track `local_size` (already downloaded bytes) separately
- Include `local_size` in all progress calculations: `local_size + offset`
- Emit `receive-resumed` event when resuming with local_size > 0
- Show correct percentage complete when resuming downloads
- Log resume information for debugging

**Impact**: Progress bars now show accurate progress when resuming interrupted downloads.

---

### 3. Temporary Directory Location Fix (Priority 1 - MEDIUM)

**File**: `src/core/receive.rs`

**Problem**: Receiver created temporary directories in `current_dir()` which is not user-friendly for GUI applications.

**Solution**:
- Changed from `std::env::current_dir()` to `std::env::temp_dir()`
- Maintains same naming pattern: `.sendme-recv-{hash}`
- More appropriate for GUI apps (hidden temp directory)

**Impact**: Temporary files now go to system temp directory, cleaner user experience.

---

## Important Improvements Implemented ✅

### 4. Import Progress Event Emission (Priority 2)

**File**: `src/core/send.rs`

**Problem**: No feedback during the import/preparation phase which can take 20+ seconds for large files (as noted in user's memory about the CoW/reflink issue).

**Solution**:
- Added `import-started` event at beginning of import
- Added `import-file-count` event with total file count
- Track files processed with `AtomicUsize` for thread-safe counting
- Emit `import-progress` events after each file: `{processed}:{total}:{percentage}`
- Added `import-completed` event at end
- Enhanced logging for debugging

**Events Emitted**:
- `import-started` - Import phase begins
- `import-file-count` - Total files to import (payload: count)
- `import-progress` - Per-file progress (payload: `processed:total:percentage`)
- `import-completed` - Import phase complete

**Impact**: Users now see progress during the slow import phase, significantly improving UX.

---

### 5. Export Progress Event Emission (Priority 2)

**File**: `src/core/receive.rs`

**Problem**: Export phase (copying files to final destination) happened silently with no user feedback.

**Solution**:
- Added `export-started` event with total file count
- Emit `export-progress` per file: `{current}:{total}:{percentage}`
- Added `export-completed` event at end
- Enhanced logging for each file export

**Events Emitted**:
- `export-started` - Export phase begins (payload: total files)
- `export-progress` - Per-file progress (payload: `current:total:percentage`)
- `export-completed` - Export phase complete

**Impact**: Users now see feedback during export, understanding what's happening after download completes.

---

### 6. Improved Error Handling for Cleanup (Priority 2)

**Files**: `src/core/receive.rs`, `src-tauri/src/state.rs`

**Problem**: Cleanup errors caused entire operation to fail even after successful transfers.

**Solution**:
- Changed cleanup operations to "best effort"
- Log warnings instead of returning errors
- Allow operations to complete successfully even if cleanup fails
- Users still informed via logs but not blocked

**Impact**: Successful transfers aren't reported as failures due to minor cleanup issues.

---

## Feature Compliance Verification ✅

### 1. Temporary Directory Management
- ✅ Creates `.sendme-send-{random}` for sending (in current_dir)
- ✅ Creates `.sendme-recv-{hash}` for receiving (NOW in system temp)
- ✅ Cleanup on success (best effort)
- ✅ Cleanup on error (best effort)
- ✅ Graceful cleanup on shutdown

### 2. Resumable Fetching
- ✅ Checks `local.is_complete()`
- ✅ Downloads only `local.missing()`
- ✅ Progress tracking accounts for `local_size`
- ✅ UI indication via `receive-resumed` event

### 3. Integrity Checks (Blake3)
- ✅ Uses iroh-blobs with Blake3 (already implemented)
- ✅ Automatic verification on send (already implemented)
- ✅ Automatic verification on receive (already implemented)
- ✅ Collection integrity verified (already implemented)

## New Events Available for Frontend

### Sender Events
- `import-started` - Import begins
- `import-file-count` (payload: count) - Total files to import
- `import-progress` (payload: `processed:total:percentage`) - Import progress
- `import-completed` - Import done
- `transfer-started` - Transfer begins
- `transfer-progress` (payload: `bytes:total:speed`) - Transfer progress
- `transfer-completed` - Transfer done

### Receiver Events
- `receive-started` - Download begins
- `receive-resumed` (payload: local_size) - Resuming previous download
- `receive-progress` (payload: `bytes:total:speed`) - Download progress
- `receive-file-names` (payload: JSON array) - File names in collection
- `export-started` (payload: file count) - Export begins
- `export-progress` (payload: `current:total:percentage`) - Export progress
- `export-completed` - Export done
- `receive-completed` - Everything complete

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Large File Send (>1GB)**
   - Verify import progress events are emitted
   - Check that preparation phase shows feedback
   - Confirm graceful shutdown works during transfer

2. **Interrupted Download + Resume**
   - Start download, interrupt it
   - Restart download with same ticket
   - Verify progress starts from correct position
   - Confirm `receive-resumed` event is emitted

3. **Sender Stop**
   - Start sharing, initiate transfer
   - Stop sharing during active transfer
   - Verify graceful shutdown (2s timeout)
   - Check temp directory cleanup

4. **Export Progress**
   - Download multi-file collection
   - Verify export progress events
   - Confirm UI shows export phase

5. **Cleanup Failures**
   - Simulate cleanup failure scenarios
   - Verify operations succeed despite cleanup issues
   - Check warning logs

## Performance Notes

From user's memory about the 20+ second preparation time:
- Issue is due to `ImportMode::TryReference` failing on different filesystems
- Forces full file copy instead of CoW/reflink
- Copy happens at ~78 MB/s for large files
- **Solution implemented**: Import progress events now provide feedback during this slow phase
- Future optimization could involve detecting filesystem compatibility or using memory-backed storage

## Code Quality

- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Thread-safe progress tracking
- ✅ Memory safety (proper Drop implementations)
- ✅ Matches CLI behavior where applicable
